# Little-Guestbook

After reading [Arowosegbe Ifeoluwa's blog post](https://blog.iifeoluwa.com/getting-started-with-nimble-2f7be8e68ffc) on Medium, 
I decided to use the idea (and mockup) as my introduction to PHP,and here is my ever-changing implementation.

### Arowosegbe Ifeoluwa's Original Idea 

> We’ll be building a very basic guestbook app that visitors to our site can utilize to leave a comment or two when they visit. 
They should also be able to view their comment(s) and that of other users that have posted in our guestbook. ‘nuff said. 
Let’s dig in.

### My Implementation

> Reproduce Ifeoluwa's mockup but with flexbox and a little colour. Use PHP for the back-end.

It's really terrible and I hope I get to look back at the code and shake my head in disgust soonest. 

That's it...
